# ENM_URIrecon

Work that is part of the Enhanced Networked Monographs project.

This repo is for experiments related to reconciling topic names with external vocabularies such as VIAF, Library of Congress, FAST, and Wikidata.

The scripts here are the second part of a workflow that starts with using OpenRefine to match topic names to external vocabularies. This part of the workflow involves gathering data from matched records via external vocabulary APIs.
